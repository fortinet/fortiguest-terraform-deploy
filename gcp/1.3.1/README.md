# Deployment of a single FortiGuest-VM on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a single FortiGuest-VM on GCP.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform >=2.11.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform Beta >=2.13
* A [GCP OAuth2 access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following :
   - A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with one public subnet
   - A FortiGuest-VM instance with one NIC
   - One firewall rule: one for the external

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGuest-VM to GCP:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Obtain a GCP OAuth2 token and input it in the vars.tf file.
   ```sh
   $ gcloud auth print-access-token
   ```
3. Customize variables in the `vars.tf` file as needed.
4. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGuest-VM instances:
```sh
FortiGuest-InstanceName = fortiguest-ebc
FortiGuest-IP = <fortiguest public IP>
FortiGuest-Username = admin
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
